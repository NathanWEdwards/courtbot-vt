-- Mathematical proof can ensure desired behaviors and properties persist

-- mathematical reasoning accomplished through machine checked verification may
-- verify an implementation from a specification is free of implementation defects
-- induced by the implementation process.
--
-- The following explores thoughtful reasoning of the Courtbot-VT application
-- through model construction and use of formal verification methods. Information
-- flow and the execution of the application may be represented by propositions
-- in a propositional logic.

-- Propositions
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- The following propositions model state and conditions common
-- to the Courtbot-VT application environment.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- Environment Variables
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- The environment_variable_is_set proposition expresses an environment variable
-- is set. An environment variable that is not set is represented by the negation
-- of this proposition.

-- The environment_variable_is_valid proposition represents an environment variable
-- that is valid. An environment variable may considered to be valid if
-- the environment variable is not set.

-- The SFTP_HOST environment variable specifies the target SSH FTP address to
-- establish an SSH FTP connection. The sftp_host proposition represents the
-- SFTP_HOST environment variable.

-- The port number the target SSH FTP server accepts is denoted by
-- the SFTP_PORT environment variable. The sftp_port proposition symbolizes this
-- environment variable.

-- The username to authenticate to the SSH FTP server is given by
-- the SFTP_USERNAME environment variable. sftp_username is a proposition that
-- denotes the SFTP_USERNAME environment variable.

-- The SFTP_PRIVATE_KEY environment variable denotes the private key for
-- SSH FTP authentication. This environment variable is represented by a proposition
-- that shares this environment variable's name, sftp_private_key.

-- MONGODB_URI is an environment variable that contains the target MongoDB address
-- to establish a MongoDB connection. The mongodb_uri proposition represents the
-- MONGODB_URI environment variable.

-- The desired MongoDB collection to write documents is denoted by
-- the mongo_collection environment variable. mongo_collection is a proposition
-- that represents the MONGO_COLLECTION environment variable.

-- The clear_ftp_server environment variable contains an expression that specifies
-- if remote files on the target SSH FTP should be removed. The clear_ftp_server
-- proposition symbolizes this environment variable.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- Connections
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- The connected proposition expresses that a connection has been established.

-- The authenticated proposition denotes an authenticated connection is established.

-- The ssh_ftp_connection is a proposition that symbolizes an SSH FTP connection.

-- The mongodb_connection is a proposition that represents a MongoDB connection.

-- The connected_ssh_ftp_connection proposition denotes an SSH FTP connection that
-- has been established. When an SSH FTP connection is not established,
-- the SSH FTP connection is in a 'disconnected' state. A disconnected state
-- of an SSH FTP connection is represented by a negated
-- connected_ssh_ftp_connection.

-- The connected_mongodb_connection proposition denotes a connection to MongoDB
-- that is connected. When a connection to the target MongoDB server
-- is not established the model is in a 'disconnected' state. A disconnected
-- state of a MongoDB connection is represented by
-- a negated connected_mongodb_connection.

-- The authenticated_ssh_ftp_connection proposition denotes an authenticated
-- connection established over SSH FTP. An established connection to an
-- SSH FTP server in which a client has successfully connected
-- to the target SSH FTP server and files can be retrieved from it, is represented
-- by this 'authenticated' state of an ssh_ftp_connection,
-- authenticated_ssh_ftp_connection.

-- The authenticated_mongodb_connection proposition, represents an established
-- authenticated connection over the MongoDB application framework.
-- A MongoDB connection is in an 'authenticated' state whenever the
-- file information transfer process has established a connection and authenticated
-- to the MongoDB server specified by the mongodb_uri environment variable.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- The file information transfer process
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- The Python ftp() method takes no arguments and is responsible for retrieving
-- a remote file over FTP and uploading its contents to MongoDB.
-- Execution of this method may be modeled as a sequence of stages
-- representd by propositions. In order, the method opens an SFTP connection,
-- retrieves a file over the SFTP connection, processes the file contents,
-- writes the processed content to MongoDB, and optionally
-- removes files over the same SFTP connection.

-- open_an_sftp_connection is a proposition that denotes a portion of the file
-- information transfer process that is executed by the ftp() method.
-- This proposition requires that the sftp_host and mongodb_uri environment
-- variables are set and valid. This proposition implies an authenticated
-- SFTP connection is made.

-- The retrieve_file_over_sftp proposition follows from the open_an_sftp_connection
-- proposition and represents execution of code within the ftp() method, the
-- retrieval and storage of a remote file to the local file system.

-- The process_file_contents proposition follows from the retrieve_file_over_sftp
-- proposition. This proposition models execution of code from within
-- an ftp() method invocation where a file stored on the local file system
-- is read and its contents processed.

-- The write_content_to_mongodb proposition follows from the process_file_contents
-- proposition. This proposition represents code execution from within the
-- ftp() method whereby an authenticated session to the target MongoDB address
-- is established and documents are written over a MongoDB connection.

-- The REMOVE_FILES proposition follows from the WRITE_CONTENT_TO_MONGODB
-- proposition.

-- process_completed_successfully is a proposition that follows from
-- the REMOVE_FILES proposition. The negation of the PROCESS_COMPLETED_SUCCESSFULLY
-- proposition represents failure in the information transfer process to complete.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- Formalization of a remote file removal process
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- The application model and implementation only guarantee file removal
-- when the CLEAR_FTP_SERVER environment variable is set to true and only after
-- successful completion of the file removal stage, the stage following
-- documents being written to MongoDB.
